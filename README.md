# Broadcast Battleship
In this lab we will be playing a game that simulates some issues that arose in construction of the internet. We will play a crazy game of Battleship where instead of playing against one other person you will play multiple games against multiple other people simultaneously – We call this “Broadcast Battleship”

In our version today, you will play in groups of 3 (4 is OK) with _no talking_. To make it easier to track, we’ve also simplified the playing board to just a 3x3 grid (instead of the classic 10x10). We’ll start by just playing with paper and pencil.

Playing and finishing the game is not the goal. The goal is develop a "question and answer" protocol and to test it with your group. Use [this activity guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hq1UNK1Q4K0LHqmu0_yeO0a0NQKHzC8W--Q0QaISHVI/edit) to describe your protocol. Log on to code.org and use the [Internet simulator](https://studio.code.org/s/csp1/stage/9/puzzle/2) to see if it works.
